  "body": "# Tournament Results Database\r\nPython module that uses a PostgreSQL database to keep track of players, matches, and results in a tournament.\r\n\r\nThe tournament uses the Swiss system for pairing up players in each round: players are not eliminated, and each player should be paired with another player with the same number of wins, or as close as possible.\r\n\r\nThis project consists of two parts: defining the database schema (SQL table definitions), and writing the code that will use it.\r\n\r\n### How can I get the code?\r\nFeel free to Fork your own version of this code and play around within the three files.\r\n\r\n### What are the technical requirements?\r\n* Python 2.7 (libraries: psycopg2, bleach)\r\n* PostgreSQL\r\n* psql\r\n\r\n### What's Included\r\nWithin the download you'll find the following files:\r\n```\r\ntournament.sql\r\ntournament.py\r\ntournament_test.py\r\nEC_test.py\r\nsim.py\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How do I run the application?\r\n1. Initialize the database using psql in command line:  psql -f tournament.sql\r\n2. Validate the tournament.py module and the tournament database schema, by running the unit tests file in command line:  python tournament_test.py\r\n3. Optionally, run a simulator to create random tournament results:  python sim.py\r\nQuery the results in the tournament database:  select * from standings_ordered;\r\n4. Optionally, execute the individual functions within the tournament.py module to interact with the database.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Application Features\r\n* Keep track of players and results for a Swiss-Style tournament (popular with Chess, Go, and MTG tournaments)\r\n* Automatically determine round-by-round pairings - each player is paired with an opponent who has won the same number of matches\r\n* Pairings will seek to prevent rematches between players with similar records\r\n* If an odd number of participants is registered, the application intelligently assigns a 'bye' to the appropriate player\r\n* Standings keeps track of players' Wins, Losses, and even Draws\r\n* Match results are tracked for history and later data discovery\r\n",
